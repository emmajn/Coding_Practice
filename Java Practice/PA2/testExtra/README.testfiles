The files in this directory contain the test cases and corresponding reference output for extra credit part of this assignment.

You can run any of these tests yourself similar to the example shown below for one of them:

    java -ea BookshelfKeeperProg < $ASNLIB/public/extra1 > myout1.out

You can then look at the difference between your extra1.out or run diff to compare them:

    diff $ASNLIB/public/extra1.out myout1.out

Make sure your output is exactly the same as the expected output.
