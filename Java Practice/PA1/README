"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, except for the the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455
Course Syllabus.  And I did not share my solution or parts of it with
other students in the course."

ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

I used examples from the chapters in the textbook regarding graphics and colors.
I used examples from the textbook on type casting double to int and vise versa.

ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):

In CS 455 what code from the web are you allowed to use in your assignment solution, assuming you modify that code once you get it? (No clue? Hint: Reread the syllabus.) Note: no need to mention the "starter files" for the assignment in your answer.

"The outside code resources students will be
allowed to use in assignments for this class are limited to code written by the course staff
for the purposes of helping students in the course, or code from the textbook for this
course."

What is the probability of each of the three outcomes in a trial: two heads, one head and one tail, and two tails? Why is one of them different than the other two?

Two head, 
both tosses have to be heads. There is 50% probability to get a head in a single toss. The outcome of one toss doesn't affect the other so it is. 50%*50% = 25%

Two Tails, 
Similar to the two heads case. Both tosses have to be tails. There is 50% probability to get a tail in a single toss. the outcome of one toss doesn't affect the other so it is. 50%*50% = 25%

One Head one Tail, 
On the first toss it can be either heads or tails. The first toss has 100% probability of being heads or tails. The second toss has to be the opposite of the first toss. It has a 50% chance of being the opposite. So the probability is 100%*50% = 50%. 


Roughly how many trials do you need to do before you mostly get results within 1% of these probabilities? Do several simulations using your program to determine an answer to this.
Assuming 
Expected Value is 
E(X) = np
Vairance is
Var(X)=np(1-p) = E((X-mean)^2)
where n is number of trials and p is probability

We want on percent so Variance should be ((p-0.01)*n-np)^2
0.01^2*n^2 = np(1-p)
n = p(1-p)/(0.01^2)

Assuming p = 0.5 for the head tail toss
About 2500 coin tosses

Roughly how many trials can you do before it crashes with an overflow error? State the largest value you tried where it still worked correctly, and one where it overflowed. You can get an idea of what general values to try by looking at the limits on Java integers (see Section 4.1.1 of the text). Play around with your program to verify that it actually works for very large values that are within the limits. Note: this kind of testing can sometimes turn up bugs, so it's good to do. Warning: For very large values you may have to wait a fair amount of time before you get the results.

Java's max value for int type:Â 2,147,483,647
